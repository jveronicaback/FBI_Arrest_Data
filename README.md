Project done for Course, GRAD 508 - Data Analytics.
It aims to:
-- Apply predictive modeling and ensemble methods
-- Extract meaningful insights from complex datasets
-- Use data transformation and evaluation tools
In this project:
Data analytics includes a wide range of techniques — from descriptive statistics to predictive modeling. It typically follows four levels:
	1.	Descriptive Analytics: What happened? (e.g., summary stats, trends)
	2.	Diagnostic Analytics: Why did it happen? (e.g., correlations, group comparisons)
	3.	Predictive Analytics: What might happen? → Machine Learning lives here
	4.	Prescriptive Analytics: What should we do? (e.g., optimization, simulation)
Traditional statistical methods (e.g., logistic regression):
	1.	They often struggle with non-linear patterns
	2.  They don’t always handle high dimensionality or class imbalance well

Ensemble methods like Random Forest and advanced ML models can capture complex patterns, especially in multiclass, real-world data 
like crime reporting.
	1. Random Forest offered both high accuracy and feature importance, which is key for policy interpretation.
  2. Logistic Regression gave you interpretable coefficients per offense class.
